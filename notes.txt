9V battery is insufficient power to control that stepper, which is rated at 1.7A. 9V batteries have a 400-600 mAh capacity and effectively max out at 500mA (0.5A, which is not enough for that Stepper)
The Servo should also have external power, especially if you’re using a MacBook Pro that’s newer than October 2013, or running Mavericks (or newer). Those mark time when the power distribution subsystems were re-engineered from the ground up, which resulted in strict enforcement of the amount of current a 5V usb peripheral was allowed to draw before the usb port was disabled. (This also marks the end of being able to charge phones via usb from a MacBook that’s closed)
There is a bit of flexibility with servos, where micro servos can probably be powered from the 5V on the board, but anything bigger will be unreliable

Voltage is not the same as Current
Voltage is a constant value, but it needs to be delivered at a rate in which the stepper can function
That delivery capacity is Current
the 9V cannot deliver its Voltage at a Current rate that’s sufficient for the Stepper to function correctly
